This project is designed for anomaly detection of video sequence. We improve the efficiency of optical flow computation with foreground mask and spacial sampling and increase the robustness of optical flow with good feature (T\+K) points selecting and forward-\/backward filtering. A foreground channel is also added to the feature vector to help detect static or low speed objects. The algorithm is validated on real-\/life traffic surveillance to prove its effectiveness. It is also evaluated on a benchmark dataset and achieve detection results comparable to state-\/of-\/art methods and outperforms them at pixel-\/level when the false alarm rate is low. The strength of our algorithm is that it runs real-\/time on the benchmark dataset which is hundreds of times faster than comparative methods.
